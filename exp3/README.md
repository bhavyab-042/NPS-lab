Description

    Verify if given message and the recieved message are error-free using the concept of a checksum.
    Detect the position of error (if it exists) in given message and the recieved message using the Hamming code.
    Both are simulations, which means only the concepts are tested out, not via actual transmission of messages but by supplying both sent and received messages.
