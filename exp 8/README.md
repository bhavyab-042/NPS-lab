Description

    Secret keys are generated via the Diffie-Hellman alogrithm based on random public keys generated by the two communicating parties.
    RSA algorithm is employed to both decrypt and encrypt an integer message after generating the public/private key pairs of both communicating parties.
    Both are mere simulations and proofs of the respective algorithm's workings; can be improved by implementing across networks.
    Both involve having pre-generated random numbers hard-coded in the codes; can be improved by randomly generating primes of larger sizes.
